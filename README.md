# Restaurant Page

Restaurant page created with HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

To make building this site more fun, I used references to the movie The Matrix.

This project was completed for The Odin Project Javascript Restaurant Page Assignment. The aim of the project was to make a functional multi page Restaurant website using WebPack to bundle files.
